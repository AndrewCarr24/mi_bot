    Why anchor: LangChain's stock `trim_messages(strategy="last")` can
    evict the current question when tool-result tokens dominate (e.g.,
    a fan-out across many filings). When that happens the agent enters
    its next turn with no question to answer and falls back to its
    persona's opener — the "I'm ready to help! What question do you
    have?" failure mode. Pinning the most-recent original HumanMessage
    outside the trim makes that impossible.

    Why "original" matters: see the _TOOL_RESULT_PREFIX comment above.
    finalize_node turns ToolMessages into HumanMessages, so without the
    `_is_original_user_message` filter the anchor would latch onto the
    last tool result and the question would still be evictable.

    `end_on=("human", "tool")` prevents stranding an AIMessage with
    `tool_calls` that lost its corresponding ToolMessage(s) — most
    providers reject that shape. (`start_on="human"` alone doesn't
    save us: it slides forward to the first HumanMessage in the
    *trimmed* list, which may not exist after trimming.)
